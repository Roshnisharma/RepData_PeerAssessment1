## Introduction

This is an R Markdown document of [Coursera](http://www.coursera.com/) "Reproducible Research" course week 2 assignment 1.This is a peer assessment. This assignment makes use of data from a personal activity monitoring device. This device collects data at 5 minute intervals through out the day. The data consists of two months of data from an anonymous individual collected during the months of October and November, 2012 and include the number of steps taken in 5 minute intervals each day.

The entire assignment in a single R markdown document that can be processed by knitr and be transformed into an HTML file.
Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


## Preparing R environment

Including libraries required

```{r activitydata, echo=TRUE}
library(ggplot2)
library(data.table)
library(dplyr)
```
##Loading and preprocessing data
This assignment makes use of data from a personal activity monitoring device. This device collects data at 5 minute intervals through out the day. The data consists of two months of data from an anonymous individual collected during the months of October and November, 2012 and include the number of steps taken in 5 minute intervals each day.

This assigment needs to show any code that is needed to
 
  1.Load the data
 
  2.Process/transform the data (if necessary) into a format suitable for your analysis

Data can be downloaded from [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip)

Note - Assuming current working directory has the the file downloaded

Checking data summary of file in the forked repository
```{r}
activitydata <- read.csv("activity.csv")
summary(activitydata)
```
##What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
For this part of the assignment, you can ignore the missing values in the dataset.

*1.Calculate the total number of steps taken per day  2.If you do not understand the difference between a histogram and a barplot, research the difference between them. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day*


```{r}
stepsperday <- summarise(group_by(activitydata, date),sum(steps))
hist(stepsperday$`sum(steps)`, breaks = 25, main = "Histogram of total steps per day")
```

*3.Calculate and report the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day*
```{r}
 m <- mean(stepsperday$`sum(steps)`, na.rm= TRUE)
 mm <- median(stepsperday$`sum(steps)`, na.rm= TRUE)
 ```
The mean is `r m` and median `r mm`  

##What is the average daily activity pattern?
*1.Make a time series plot of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)*
```{r}
 meansteps <- summarise(group_by(activitydata, interval),mean(steps,na.rm= TRUE))
 plot(meansteps$interval, meansteps$`mean(steps, na.rm = TRUE)`, type = "l", xlab = "5 Minute Interval", ylab = "Average steps taken", main = "Daily activity pattern")
 
```
 
 
*2.Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?*
```{r}
max_meansteps <- which.max(meansteps$`mean(steps, na.rm = TRUE)`)
m3 <- meansteps[max_meansteps,]
```
`r m3[[1]]`th interval contains maximum `r m3[[2]]` number of steps

##Imputing missing values

*Note that there are a number of days/intervals where there are missing values.The presence of missing days may introduce bias into some calculations or summaries of the data.
1.Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset 

```{r}
missing_vals <- sum(is.na(activitydata$steps))
```
the total number of missing values are `r missing_vals`

*2.Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset. The strategy does not need to be sophisticated. For example, you could use the mean/median for that day, or the mean for that 5-minute interval, etc.*

To populate missing values the mean of that day for that 5 - minute interval is chosen.
Create *na_rows* to have all row numbers with na values. 
```{r}
na_rows <- which(is.na(activitydata$steps))
```
Create *na_replace* to have all values that need to be replaced with. 
```{r}
na_replace <- unlist(lapply(na_rows,FUN = function(x) {
  intervalval <- activitydata[x,]$interval
  fillval <- meansteps[meansteps$interval == intervalval,]$`mean(steps, na.rm = TRUE)`
}))
```
*3.Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.*
Then we fill all values in the data set that has na.
```{r}
activitydata1<- activitydata
activitydata1[na_rows,]$steps <- na_replace
```
Check 
```{r}
str(activitydata1)
```
NOw we Check for na.
```{r}
sum(is.na(activitydata1$steps))
```

*4.Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day.*
```{r}
stepsperday1 <- summarise(group_by(activitydata1, date),sum(steps))
hist(stepsperday1$`sum(steps)`, breaks = 25, main = "Histogram of total steps per day")
```
*Calculate and report the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day*
```{r}
 m1 <- mean(stepsperday1$`sum(steps)`, na.rm= TRUE)
 mm1 <- median(stepsperday1$`sum(steps)`, na.rm= TRUE)
```
The mean is `r m1` and median `r mm1`  

*Do these values differ from the estimates from the first part of the assignment?*  
    
  Earlier   - The mean is `r m` and median `r mm` 
   
  Afterfill - The mean is `r m1` and median `r mm1`  

*What is the impact of imputing missing data on the estimates of the total daily number of steps?*

    The mean has not changed but there is sligh difference in median which has moved median towards mean. which is understandable because of our fill strategy.The histogram shows there are more values at the peak but no other change in distribution.
    
##Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

*For this part the weekday function may be of some help here. Use the dataset with the filled-in missing values for this part.  1.Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels - "weekday" and "weekend" indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.*

```{r}
 activitydata1$weekdayname <- ifelse(weekdays(as.Date(activitydata1$date))=="Saturday" | weekdays(as.Date(activitydata1$date))=="Sunday", "weekend", "weekday")
  
  weekdays <- activitydata1 %>% group_by(weekdayname, interval) %>% summarise(mean.steps=mean(steps))
```

*2.Make a panel plot containing a time series plot of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis). See the README file in the GitHub repository to see an example of what this plot should look like using simulated data.*

```{r}
meanstepsbyweekdays <- activitydata1 %>% group_by(weekdayname, interval) %>% summarise(mean.steps=mean(steps))
  ggplot(meanstepsbyweekdays, aes(x=interval, y= mean.steps))+ geom_line(color = "red")+facet_wrap(~ weekdayname, nrow=2, ncol=1)+labs(x="Interval",y="Average steps taken")
```
 
 We can see more walking in weekday one peak whereas in weekend it is distributed across with lesser height in peak.
